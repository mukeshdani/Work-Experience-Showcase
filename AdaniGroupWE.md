# Detailed Project Summary

### üè• (Healthcare Module) Intelligent Automation in Healthcare Systems

Integrated a new line of business into the enterprise EHR application, enabling seamless onboarding of clinical workflows. Leveraged **Google Speech-to-Text** and **custom NLP pipelines** to automate doctor-patient interactions, converting spoken consultations into structured medical notes.

To further enhance clinical productivity, developed a **LangChain + GPT-4 powered clinical assistant chatbot** capable of:
- Summarizing patient history from EHR records.
- Generating draft prescriptions based on symptoms and prior diagnoses.
- Interacting in real-time with doctors using natural language.

**Why**  
To reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals and improve clinical accuracy through intelligent, autonomous agents.

**Impact:**  
‚úÖ Reduced documentation time by **70%**  
‚úÖ Improved prescription accuracy by **85%**  
‚úÖ Scaled to support **1,000+ daily interactions**

### üë•(Employee Attendance Data Management Tool) Scalable Employee Attendance Data Management

Led the end-to-end development of a centralized attendance data platform for **50,000+ employees**. Unified disparate data sources into a **single SQL-based data lake** using Python ETL pipelines. Built robust backend microservices in **Node.js** and **Python**, supporting a React-based frontend for HR operations.

Integrated **agentic AI** in two key areas:
- A **predictive analytics agent** that detects anomalies in attendance patterns using historical trends.
- A **RAG-based HR chatbot** that answers employee queries on attendance and leave policies by retrieving relevant data and generating responses using OpenAI.

**Why**  
To enable real-time, conversational access to HR data and automate insights for proactive workforce management.

**Impact:**  
‚úÖ Reduced data retrieval time by **80%**  
‚úÖ Enhanced decision-making accuracy by **90%**

### üìä (Talent Acquisition Dashboard) AI-Powered Talent Acquisition Dashboard & Data Lake Development

Built a comprehensive **talent acquisition dashboard** and centralized **data lake** by integrating data from **Oracle Fusion, HRMS, and Tydy** using APIs and SQL. Ensured **97% data accuracy** and implemented an **admin portal** for secure access control.

Deployed a suite of **agentic AI capabilities** to automate and optimize recruitment:
- **Resume Parsing Agent**: Used NLP (NER, section classification, skill extraction) to convert unstructured resumes into structured profiles.
- **Candidate Matching Agent**: Applied semantic similarity and rule-based filters to match candidates with job requirements.
- **Recruiter Assistant Chatbot**: Built with **LangChain Agents + OpenAI**, enabling recruiters to:
  - Retrieve real-time hiring metrics (e.g., open requisitions, pipeline status).
  - Summarize candidate profiles and interview feedback.
  - Automate workflows like interview scheduling and status updates.

**Why**  
To reduce manual effort, improve candidate-job fit, and empower recruiters with intelligent, conversational tools.

**Impact:**  
‚úÖ 90% improvement in reporting efficiency  
‚úÖ 97% enhancement in data security and accuracy  
‚úÖ Significant boost in recruiter productivity and hiring quality

### üîä **Google Speech-to-Text Integration**
You integrated Google‚Äôs Speech-to-Text API to transcribe real-time doctor-patient conversations into structured text. This was achieved by:
- Capturing audio streams from consultation sessions.
- Using Google‚Äôs API to convert speech into text with medical vocabulary support.
- Feeding the transcribed text into downstream NLP pipelines for further processing.

**Why this was done:**  
To eliminate the need for manual note-taking during consultations and ensure accurate, real-time capture of clinical interactions.

---

### üß† **Custom NLP Pipelines**
You built custom NLP pipelines to extract and structure clinical information from the transcribed text. This included:
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to identify symptoms, medications, and diagnoses.
- **Intent classification** to detect the purpose of the conversation (e.g., diagnosis, follow-up).
- **Section segmentation** to organize the conversation into SOAP format (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan).
- **Custom APIs** were developed using Python (FastAPI/Flask) to expose these NLP services, which were then consumed by the LangChain-based clinical assistant.

**Why this was done**  
To transform unstructured conversation data into structured clinical summaries and enable the GPT-4 assistant to generate accurate draft prescriptions and patient notes.
